MapReduce
    MapReduce is a programming model for data processing.
    MAP AND REDUCE
    MapReduce works by breaking the processing into two phases: the map phase and the reduce phase. Each phase has key-value pairs as input and output, the types of which may be chosen by the programmer. The programmer also specifies two functions: the map function and the reduce function.
